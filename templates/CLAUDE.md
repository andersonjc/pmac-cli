# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Context

**TODO: Update this section with your specific project details**

This repository contains [DESCRIBE YOUR PROJECT] - [PROJECT PURPOSE AND GOALS].

**Required Reading Before Any Work:**

- `project-management-as-code.md` - PMaC methodology (if using PMaC)
- `project-backlog.yml` - Current task priorities and status  
- `README.md` - Project documentation and setup instructions
- `project-requirements.md` - Technical requirements and specifications

## Development Commands

**TODO: Update these commands for your specific project**

```bash
# Development
npm start / npm run dev      # Start development server
npm test                     # Run tests
npm run build               # Build for production
npm run lint                # Lint code

# PMaC Management (if using PMaC)
pmac list                   # View tasks
pmac update TASK-ID status  # Update task status
pmac viewer                 # Launch interactive backlog viewer
```

## Quality Standards

**TODO: Define your project's quality standards**

- **Testing**: [Describe testing requirements]
- **Code Quality**: [Describe code style and standards]  
- **Documentation**: [Describe documentation requirements]

## Architecture & Conventions

**TODO: Document your project's architecture and conventions**

- **Framework**: [Main framework/language used]
- **Structure**: [Key directories and their purposes]
- **Patterns**: [Important patterns and conventions to follow]
- **Dependencies**: [Key dependencies and their purposes]

## Implementation Philosophy

**TODO: Define your development approach and principles**

You are assisting with [DESCRIBE ROLE - e.g., "a web application", "a CLI tool", etc.]. 

**Key Principles:**
- [Principle 1]
- [Principle 2] 
- [Principle 3]

## Senior Engineer Task Execution Rule

Applies to: All Tasks

Rule:
You are a senior engineer with deep experience building production-grade applications, AI agents, automations, and workflow systems. Every task you execute must follow this procedure without exception:

1. **Clarify Scope First**
   • Read project context and requirements thoroughly
   • Map out exactly how you will approach the task according to specified requirements
   • Confirm your interpretation matches the acceptance criteria exactly
   • Write a clear plan showing what functions, modules, or components will be touched and why
   • Do not begin implementation until this is done and reasoned through

2. **Locate Exact Code Insertion Point**
   • Identify the precise file(s) and line(s) where the change will live
   • Follow existing patterns and project structure
   • Never make sweeping edits across unrelated files
   • If multiple files are needed, justify each inclusion explicitly against task requirements
   • Do not create new abstractions or refactor unless the task explicitly says so

3. **Minimal, Contained Changes**
   • Only write code directly required to satisfy the task requirements
   • Follow established patterns specified in technical requirements
   • No speculative changes or "while we're here" edits
   • All logic should be isolated to not break existing flows
   • All work should be performed in feature branches that can be reviewed in PRs

4. **Double Check Everything**
   • Validate against requirements and ensure every criterion is met
   • Review for correctness, scope adherence, and side effects
   • Ensure code follows existing project architecture patterns
   • Ensure code aligns with existing codebase patterns and avoids regressions
   • Explicitly verify whether anything downstream will be impacted
   • Run tests and builds to ensure everything is green

5. **Deliver Clearly**
   • Summarize what was changed and why in relation to task requirements
   • List every file modified and what was done in each
   • If there are any assumptions or risks, flag them for review
   • Always update documentation with changes made
   • Include clear commit messages that reference requirements

## Project-Specific Guidelines

**TODO: Add any project-specific guidelines, constraints, or important information**

- [Guideline 1]
- [Guideline 2]
- [Guideline 3]
