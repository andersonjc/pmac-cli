## Project Management as Code (PMaC)

This project follows the **Project Management as Code (PMaC)** methodology for AI-assisted development. All project management data is version-controlled alongside the codebase.

### PMaC Files

- **`project-management-as-code.md`** - Complete PMaC methodology documentation
- **`project-backlog.yml`** - Task management, dependencies, and progress tracking
- **`prompts-log.md`** - Complete conversation history and decision audit trail
- **`CLAUDE.md`** - AI assistant instructions and project-specific guidance
- **`[project]-requirements.md`** - Technical requirements and architecture specifications

These files work together to maintain complete project context and enable seamless AI-assisted development.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [List your project's prerequisites, e.g., Node.js 18+, Python 3.9+, etc.]
- [Package manager: pnpm, npm, yarn, pip, etc.]

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/[username]/[repository].git
cd [repository]

# Install dependencies
[your install command, e.g., pnpm install, pip install -r requirements.txt]

### PMaC CLI (Project Management)

This project includes a CLI tool for managing PMaC workflows:

```bash
# View current tasks
pmac list

# Update task status
pmac update TASK-001 in_progress "Starting implementation"

# View critical path
pmac critical-path

# Validate dependencies
pmac validate

# See all available commands
pmac help
```

## Development

### Getting Started with PMaC

1. **Read the methodology**: Start with `project-management-as-code.md`
2. **Check current tasks**: Review `project-backlog.yml` for ready tasks
3. **Follow the workflow**: Update task status as you work
4. **Log decisions**: Document all technical decisions in `prompts-log.md`
5. **Commit PMaC files**: Always commit PMaC files with code changes

### Development Commands

```bash
# Development
pnpm dev          # Start development server
pnpm build        # Build for production
pnpm test         # Run all tests

# Code Quality
pnpm lint         # Run linting
pnpm format       # Format code
pnpm typecheck    # Type checking (if using TypeScript)

# PMaC Management
pmac list    # View tasks
pmac help    # PMaC CLI help
```

### Testing

[Describe your testing strategy and how to run tests]

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run specific test suites
pnpm test:unit
pnpm test:integration
pnpm test:e2e

# Test coverage
pnpm test:coverage
```

## Contributing

### PMaC Workflow for Contributors

1. **Review PMaC files**: Understand current project state
2. **Choose a task**: Pick a "ready" task from `project-backlog.yml`
3. **Create feature branch**: `git checkout -b feature/TASK-ID-description`
4. **Update task status**: Mark as "in_progress" using PMaC CLI
5. **Implement changes**: Follow acceptance criteria exactly
6. **Update PMaC files**: Document decisions and update task status
7. **Create pull request**: Include PMaC file updates
