## [Unreleased]

> Enhanced viewer reliability and CLI usability improvements ðŸ”§

### ðŸš€ New Features

- **Version Display**: Added `--version`, `-v`, and `version` commands to display package version
- **Dynamic Port Selection**: Viewer automatically finds available ports when default port 5173 is in use
- **Enhanced Help Output**: Help command now displays version information in header and examples

### ðŸ›  Fixes

- **Viewer Path Resolution**: Fixed viewer command failing in global installations by implementing robust package root detection
- **Port Conflict Handling**: Viewer now gracefully handles port conflicts with clear user messaging
- **Version Detection**: Fixed version display showing "unknown" in global installations
- **Error Messages**: Improved viewer error messages with debugging information and solution suggestions

### ðŸ§ª Testing

- Added 5 new unit tests for port discovery functionality
- Added 3 new integration tests for viewer command with port conflict scenarios
- All 58 tests passing including new functionality
- Improved test reliability and coverage for edge cases

### ðŸŽ¯ Performance

- **Automatic Port Discovery**: `findAvailablePort()` efficiently scans for available ports (5173-5182 range)
- **Smart Path Resolution**: Package root detection works across development and production environments
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Clear messaging when alternate ports are used

### ðŸ“š Documentation

- Updated help text and usage examples for consistency
- Added version command documentation and examples
- Enhanced error messages with actionable troubleshooting steps

### ðŸ”§ Internal
