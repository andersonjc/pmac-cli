      - Dark mode Svelte application with responsive design
      - YAML parsing with validation and error handling
      - Interactive task visualization with filtering
      - Critical path analysis with dependency graph
      - PMaC CLI integration with subcommands

      - Project Management as Code proven effective for viewer development
      - Documentation enables future viewer enhancements
risks:
  high:
    - risk: SVG dependency graph performance with large projects
      mitigation: Implement virtualization and lazy loading for complex graphs
    - risk: Mobile responsiveness complexity for data-heavy interface
      mitigation: Progressive enhancement approach with mobile-first design
  medium:
    - risk: PMaC CLI integration complexity
      mitigation: Early integration testing and clear interface definition
    - risk: TypeScript compilation complexity with Svelte
      mitigation: Use proven Vite + Svelte TypeScript configuration
  low:
    - risk: Tailwind CSS bundle size impact
      mitigation: Use Tailwind's purge/JIT mode for production builds
    - risk: Cross-browser compatibility issues
      mitigation: Focus on modern browsers with documented requirements
