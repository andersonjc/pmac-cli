## [1.4.0] - 2025-08-04

> Prompt logging CLI integration with comprehensive testing infrastructure 📝

### 🚀 New Features

- **PMaC Integration**: Full integration with existing PMaC methodology and file structure

### 🛠 Testing Infrastructure

- **Non-Watch Mode Tests**: Fixed test configuration to run with `vitest run` instead of watch mode
- **File Protection**: Implemented backup/restore pattern for `prompts-log.md` during testing
- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: Added 6 integration tests covering all log-prompt functionality
- **Project History Preservation**: Tests no longer delete or corrupt existing project history files

### 🛠 Fixes

- **TypeScript Configuration**: Updated module settings from ESNext to ES2022 for import.meta and top-level await support
- **TypeScript Project References**: Added proper composite project structure for better IDE support
- **Test File Type Issues**: Fixed setTimeout and error parameter type annotations in test files
- **Unused Import Cleanup**: Removed unused imports and added proper type annotations

### 📚 Documentation

- **CLAUDE.md Directives**: Updated with clear instructions to use `pmac log-prompt` command instead of manual file editing
- **README CLI Commands**: Added log-prompt command documentation with usage examples
- **PMaC Methodology Compliance**: Emphasized automatic timestamp generation and proper workflow
- **Usage Examples**: Added practical examples for common prompt logging scenarios

### 🧪 Testing

- **6 New Integration Tests**: Comprehensive coverage of log-prompt command functionality
- **Backup/Restore Testing**: Verification that original files are preserved during test execution
- **Error Handling Tests**: Validation of argument checking and error messages
- **Multi-scenario Coverage**: Tests for single prompts, multi-word prompts, special characters, and edge cases

### 🎯 Performance

- **Efficient File Operations**: Streamlined backup/restore mechanisms in test infrastructure
- **Clean Test Execution**: Tests complete automatically without manual intervention
- **File System Safety**: No risk of data loss during test execution

### 🔧 Internal

- **TypeScript Project Structure**: Enhanced with proper project references and composite configurations
- **Test Infrastructure**: Robust file protection patterns following existing project conventions
- **Code Quality**: Improved type safety and eliminated IDE diagnostics issues
- **PMaC Compliance**: All changes follow Project Management as Code methodology

## [1.3.0] - 2025-07-26

> Phase management and enhanced validation with timestamp improvements 🛠

### 🚀 New Features

- **Phase Creation Command**: Added `pmac phase-create <phaseId> <title> <description> [duration]` command for creating new project phases
- **Enhanced Task ID Validation**: Intelligent suggestions for alternative task IDs when duplicates are detected
- **Pattern Validation**: Smart recommendations for better task ID conventions (uppercase, numbered patterns)
- **Cross-Phase Uniqueness**: Clear error messages showing which phase contains existing task IDs

### 🛠 Fixes

- **Timestamp Standardization**: All timestamp generation now uses consistent PMaC format: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS a.m./p.m. [LOCAL_TZ]`
- **Dynamic Timezone Detection**: Timestamps now detect actual local timezone instead of hardcoded EDT
- **TypeScript Compilation**: Fixed unused variable error in `suggestTaskIds` method
- **Code Quality**: Centralized timestamp logic, eliminated code duplication

### 📚 Documentation

- **Task ID Uniqueness**: Updated all documentation to clarify task IDs must be unique across entire backlog
- **Enhanced Help Text**: Phase creation command included in help output with examples
- **Error Messages**: Improved clarity about uniqueness requirements and validation failures
- **README Updates**: Added task ID uniqueness requirements and best practices

### 🧪 Testing

- Added 5 new tests for phase creation functionality
- Added cross-phase uniqueness validation test
- Enhanced test descriptions for better clarity
- All 69 tests passing with new functionality
- Comprehensive test coverage for timestamp methods

### 🎯 Performance

- **Centralized Logic**: All timestamp generation through single `formatTimestamp()` method
- **Reduced Duplication**: Eliminated 24+ lines of duplicate timestamp code
- **Improved Validation**: Faster task ID suggestion algorithms

### 🔧 Internal

- Cleaned up test data from project backlog
- Improved code organization and maintainability
- Better error handling and user experience
- Enhanced CLI usability with smart suggestions

## [1.2.0] - 2025-07-24

> Enhanced viewer reliability and CLI usability improvements 🔧

### 🚀 New Features

- **Version Display**: Added `--version`, `-v`, and `version` commands to display package version
- **Dynamic Port Selection**: Viewer automatically finds available ports when default port 5173 is in use
- **Enhanced Help Output**: Help command now displays version information in header and examples

### 🛠 Fixes

- **Viewer Path Resolution**: Fixed viewer command failing in global installations by implementing robust package root detection
- **Port Conflict Handling**: Viewer now gracefully handles port conflicts with clear user messaging
- **Version Detection**: Fixed version display showing "unknown" in global installations
- **Error Messages**: Improved viewer error messages with debugging information and solution suggestions

### 🧪 Testing

- Added 5 new unit tests for port discovery functionality
- Added 3 new integration tests for viewer command with port conflict scenarios
- All 58 tests passing including new functionality
- Improved test reliability and coverage for edge cases

### 🎯 Performance

- **Automatic Port Discovery**: `findAvailablePort()` efficiently scans for available ports (5173-5182 range)
- **Smart Path Resolution**: Package root detection works across development and production environments
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Clear messaging when alternate ports are used

### 📚 Documentation

- Updated help text and usage examples for consistency
- Added version command documentation and examples
- Enhanced error messages with actionable troubleshooting steps

### 🔧 Internal

- Refactored version detection to use same robust path logic as viewer assets
- Improved error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Enhanced TypeScript type safety and code organization
