# Project Management as Code (PMaC)

A file-based methodology and toolkit for AI-assisted software development that keeps all project management data version-controlled alongside your codebase.

## Why PMaC?

Traditional project management tools (Jira, Linear, Asana) store data in proprietary systems that don't integrate well with AI coding assistants. PMaC solves this by using **version-controlled files** that provide complete project context to both humans and AI.

### Key Benefits

- **🤖 AI-Native**: Structured YAML/Markdown that AI assistants can read and update
- **📝 Complete Audit Trail**: Every decision, requirement change, and prompt is tracked
- **⚡ Zero Context Loss**: Resume complex projects seamlessly with full historical context
- **🔄 Git Integration**: Project management data evolves with your code
- **🏗️ Quality Assurance**: Built-in protocols ensure production-ready code

## Quick Start

### For New Projects

```bash
# Clone PMaC template
git clone https://github.com/andersonjc/pmac.git my-project
cd my-project

# Install CLI tool
pnpm add -D yaml tsx @types/node

# Initialize your project files
cp templates/* .
# Edit files to match your project

# Start managing tasks
pnpm pmac list
```

### For Existing Projects

```bash
# Add PMaC files to your existing project
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andersonjc/pmac/main/templates/project-backlog.yml
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andersonjc/pmac/main/templates/CLAUDE.md
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andersonjc/pmac/main/templates/prompts-log.md

# Add CLI tool
pnpm add -D yaml tsx @types/node
# Copy tools/pmac.ts to your project
```

## Core PMaC Files

PMaC uses four interconnected files that work together:

| File | Purpose | Format |
|------|---------|---------|
| **`project-backlog.yml`** | Task management, dependencies, status tracking | YAML |
| **`prompts-log.md`** | Complete conversation history and decisions | Markdown |
| **`CLAUDE.md`** | AI assistant instructions and project guidance | Markdown |
| **`project-requirements.md`** | Technical architecture and requirements | Markdown |

## PMaC CLI

Powerful command-line tool for managing your PMaC workflow:

```bash
# Task Management
pnpm pmac list [status] [priority]     # List tasks with filters
pnpm pmac update TASK-001 in_progress  # Update task status
pnpm pmac create "New Feature" dev      # Create new task

# Project Analysis
pnpm pmac critical-path                 # Show project critical path
pnpm pmac validate                      # Validate dependencies
pnpm pmac phases                        # List all project phases

# Dependencies
pnpm pmac add-dep TASK-001 SETUP-001   # Add task dependency
pnpm pmac rm-dep TASK-001 SETUP-001    # Remove dependency
```

## Optional Tools

### Git Pre-Commit Hook

PMaC includes an optional pre-commit hook that enforces PMaC compliance by ensuring PMaC files are updated whenever code changes are committed.

**Installation** (optional):
```bash
# Copy the hook to your git hooks directory
cp tools/resources/pmac-pre-commit-hook .git/hooks/pre-commit
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

**What it does**:
- Detects when code files are being committed
- Ensures corresponding PMaC files (`project-backlog.yml`, `prompts-log.md`) are also staged
- Auto-stages modified PMaC files if they exist but aren't staged
- Blocks commits that don't follow PMaC methodology

**Note**: This hook is a resource for teams that want to enforce PMaC compliance. It's not required to use PMaC methodology.

## Development Workflow

### 1. Pick a Task
```bash
pnpm pmac list ready high  # Find high-priority ready tasks
```

### 2. Start Work
```bash
pnpm pmac update TASK-001 in_progress "Starting implementation"
git checkout -b feature/TASK-001-description
```

### 3. Follow Protocol
- ✅ Read task requirements and acceptance criteria
- ✅ Follow technical requirements exactly
- ✅ Update task notes with implementation decisions
- ✅ Log all AI prompts in `prompts-log.md`

### 4. Complete & Validate
```bash
# Validate all acceptance criteria met
pnpm pmac update TASK-001 completed "All criteria validated"

# Commit PMaC files with code changes
git add .
git commit -m "TASK-001: Implement feature XYZ

✅ All acceptance criteria met
📝 Updated PMaC files
🤖 Generated with Claude Code"
```

## Example Task Structure

```yaml
# project-backlog.yml
phases:
  development:
    tasks:
      - id: AUTH-001
        title: "Implement JWT Authentication"
        status: "ready"
        priority: "high"
        estimated_hours: 8
        requirements:
          - "Create JWT token generation endpoint"
          - "Implement token validation middleware"
          - "Add refresh token mechanism"
        acceptance_criteria:
          - "✅ Users can login and receive valid JWT tokens"
          - "✅ Protected routes validate tokens correctly"
          - "✅ Refresh tokens work without re-authentication"
          - "✅ All tests pass with >95% coverage"
        dependencies: ["SETUP-001"]
        notes: []
```

## Quality Assurance

PMaC includes a **Senior Engineer Task Execution Protocol**:

1. **📋 Clarify Scope**: Map requirements to specific implementation
2. **🎯 Locate Insertion Points**: Identify exact files and lines to modify  
3. **⚡ Minimal Changes**: Only code required for acceptance criteria
4. **✅ Validate Everything**: Run tests, check criteria, verify no regressions
5. **📝 Document & Update**: Update PMaC files with all changes

## Best Practices

### For Teams
- Always commit PMaC files with code changes
- Use task IDs in branch names and commit messages  
- Include acceptance criteria validation in PRs
- Review PMaC files during code reviews

### For AI Collaboration
- Log every prompt and decision in `prompts-log.md`
- Update task status as work progresses
- Reference task IDs when asking for help
- Maintain complete audit trail

### For Quality
- Write specific, testable acceptance criteria
- Aim for 100% test coverage on new code
- Follow the Senior Engineer Protocol religiously
- Validate all criteria before marking tasks complete

## Acknowledgments

This methodology was inspired by Max Mitchell's concept of "prompts as source code" from his analysis of [Cloudflare's Claude-generated commits](https://www.maxemitchell.com/writings/i-read-all-of-cloudflares-claude-generated-commits/).

The independent emergence of similar concepts, such as the [PMAC project](https://github.com/schneidergithub/pmac) by schneidergithub, demonstrates the industry's shared need for standardized AI-assisted development practices.
