# Project Management as Code (PMaC)

A file-based methodology for AI-assisted software development.

## The Problem

Traditional PM tools (Jira, Linear, Asana) don't integrate with AI assistants. Context gets lost, decisions aren't tracked, and there's no standard way to maintain project continuity when working with AI.

## The Solution

Version-controlled files that provide complete project context to both humans and AI assistants.

## Core Files

| File                          | Purpose                                                   |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`project-backlog.yml`**     | Tasks, dependencies, status tracking, acceptance criteria |
| **`prompts-log.md`**          | User prompts only - verbatim conversation log            |
| **`project-requirements.md`** | Technical architecture and specifications                 |
| **`CLAUDE.md`**               | AI assistant instructions and project guidance            |

## Key Benefits

- **🤖 AI-Native**: YAML/Markdown format AI assistants can read and update
- **📝 Complete Audit Trail**: Every decision tracked in version control
- **⚡ Zero Context Loss**: Resume complex projects with full context
- **🔄 Git Integration**: PM data evolves alongside code
- **🏗️ Quality Assurance**: Built-in protocols ensure production-ready code

## Workflow

### Before Starting Work

1. Read next "ready" task from `project-backlog.yml` (highest priority)
2. Update task status to "in_progress"
3. Review requirements and acceptance criteria

### During Development

1. **Immediately log user prompts verbatim** in `prompts-log.md` with current local timestamp
2. Update task notes with implementation decisions via PMaC CLI
3. Follow technical requirements exactly

### Timestamp Standards

**All PMaC files must use consistent local timezone format:**
- **Format**: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS a.m./p.m. EDT` (e.g., "2025-06-24 03:25:00 p.m. EDT")
- **Source**: JavaScript `new Date().toLocaleString('en-CA', {year: 'numeric', month: '2-digit', day: '2-digit', hour: '2-digit', minute: '2-digit', second: '2-digit', timeZoneName: 'short'}).replace(',', '')`
- **Application**: Both prompts-log.md manual entries and PMaC CLI automated timestamps

### Before Committing

1. Validate ALL acceptance criteria are met
2. Update task status and add milestone notes via PMaC CLI
3. Commit PMaC files with code changes
4. Include task ID in commit message

### File Separation Guidelines

**prompts-log.md**: 
- User prompts ONLY, verbatim
- Minimal context, just timestamp and prompt text
- No analysis, decisions, or implementation details

**project-backlog.yml** (via PMaC CLI):
- Implementation decisions and rationale
- Technical milestones and progress notes  
- Architecture decisions and trade-offs
- Test results and validation status

## Git Integration

```bash
# Feature branches
git checkout -b feature/TASK-001-description

# Commit with task ID
git commit -m "TASK-001: Implement feature XYZ

✅ All acceptance criteria met
📝 Updated PMaC files"

# PR titles reference tasks
"TASK-001: Implementation of JWT authentication"
```

## File Structure

├── project-management-as-code.md    # This methodology
├── project-backlog.yml               # Task management
├── prompts-log.md                    # Decision log

└── src/                             # Application code
```

## Quality Standards

- **Tests**: 100% coverage on new code, all tests pass
- **Dependencies**: Validate with `pnpm pmac validate`
- **Documentation**: Update with all code changes
- **Security**: Input validation, secure patterns, audit logs

## Task Structure Example

```yaml
# project-backlog.yml
phases:
  development:
    tasks:
      - id: AUTH-001
        title: "Implement JWT Authentication"
        status: "ready"
        priority: "high"
        estimated_hours: 8
        requirements:
          - "Create JWT token generation endpoint"
          - "Implement token validation middleware"
        acceptance_criteria:
          - "✅ Users can login and receive valid tokens"
          - "✅ Protected routes validate tokens correctly"
          - "✅ All tests pass with >95% coverage"
        dependencies: ["SETUP-001"]
```

## PMaC vs Traditional PM

| Aspect           | Traditional Tools  | PMaC                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | --------------------- |
| AI Integration   | Manual/None        | Native                |
| Decision Context | Lost               | Complete              |
| Version Control  | External           | Full Integration      |
| Audit Trail      | Platform-dependent | Git + prompts + tasks |
| Quality Control  | External processes | Built-in protocols    |

## PMaC CLI Tool

Optional TypeScript CLI for enhanced workflows:

```bash
# Installation
pnpm add -D yaml tsx @types/node

# Key Commands
pnpm pmac list [status] [priority]    # List filtered tasks
pnpm pmac update TASK-001 in_progress # Update status
pnpm pmac validate                     # Check dependencies
pnpm pmac critical-path                # Show critical path
```

## Getting Started

1. **Initialize Files**: Copy PMaC templates to your project root
2. **Install CLI**: `pnpm add -D yaml tsx @types/node`
3. **Configure**: Add `"pmac": "tsx tools/pmac.ts"` to package.json scripts
4. **Start Working**: Pick tasks from `project-backlog.yml` and follow workflow

## Best Practices

**Task Definition:**

- Write specific, testable acceptance criteria
- Include testing requirements
- Reference technical requirements
- Estimate effort realistically

**Documentation:**

- Log every AI prompt in `prompts-log.md`
- Document architectural decisions
- Update PMaC files with code changes
- Use task IDs in commits and branches

**Quality:**

- Follow Senior Engineer Protocol for every task
- Validate all criteria before marking complete
- Run tests, lint, build before committing
- Maintain 100% test coverage on new code

## Common Pitfalls

- **Skipping PMaC updates** → Use Git hooks to enforce
- **Vague criteria** → Write specific, measurable outcomes
- **Incomplete logging** → Log every interaction verbatim
- **Poor dependencies** → Use CLI validation to prevent cycles

This methodology was inspired by Max Mitchell's concept of "prompts as source code" from his analysis of [Cloudflare's Claude-generated commits](https://www.maxemitchell.com/writings/i-read-all-of-cloudflares-claude-generated-commits/).

The independent emergence of similar concepts, such as the [PMAC project](https://github.com/schneidergithub/pmac) by schneidergithub, demonstrates the industry's shared need for standardized AI-assisted development practices.
